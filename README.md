# RTSP Camera Stream & Snapshot Web App

## üöÄ Features

- Live RTSP video stream using OpenCV and Flask.
- Snapshot capture from the live stream.
- Stores captured images in a local folder.
- Logs snapshot details (name, path, timestamp) to an Excel file.
- Web-based interface with preview boxes.
- Support for dual-camera capture (extendable).


## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- HTML5 / CSS
